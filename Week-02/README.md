This is my Week 02 task for the Edulumos Internship.

📌 Project Description

A simple and responsive To-Do List Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The app allows users to manage daily tasks — add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.
All tasks are saved using browser local storage, so the list remains even after refreshing the page.
